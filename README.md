## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- w3.css
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There's probably countless ways to solve this problem and I may have found one. When working with w3.css, it has a good starting point for common elements that I can then go in and add to or modify if needed.

I also started looking into CSS naming conventions. I used BEM today for my classes. I think it's a nice combination to quickly see if it's my CSS that is causing issues or not.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

<!-- I remembered the alt tag -->
<img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code" width="100%">

```
```css
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
    /*forced me to work mobile first*/
}
```

### Continued development

I was unable to find the Designer View in VS Code and so I was forced to eyeball this project. Proportionally, it's possibly pretty close, but I'd like to revisit this in the future with a better design.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.example.com) - This helped me to grasp what w3.css can do and provided examples that I could work from.
